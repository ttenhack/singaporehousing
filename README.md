# Price prediction algorithm of HDB in Singapore

In Singapore, housing is provided by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) under a fixed lease term of 99 years [1]. When the buildings are developed under governmental supervision, Singaporeans can buy an apartment in such a flat. When buying, they hold the ownership for 99 years before it becomes property of the government again. Within this period of time, property owners are allowed to sell their property on the market.

To better understand the market of housing prices in Singapore, we aim to develop a prediction algorithm. The dataset used to predict future prices of these flats is based on an extensive dataset from the Singaporean government [2]. They provide sets of data dating from 1990 until January 2018, which are combined into a single dataset. The dataset consists of over 750,000 sales concatenating all townships in Singapore.
